This is a simple python implementation of the pixel signature scheme.
It is build on top of [the python code for bls signatures](https://github.com/algorand/bls_sigs_ref-fork/tree/master/python-impl).

This code generates test vectors for the scheme, that is used to
cross compare with rust's test vectors, to ensure the correctness
of the implementation.

This code is of low quality, and should not be used for any purpose
other than testing and debugging.
